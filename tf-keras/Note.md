# Note
It is completely different between Tensorflow v1 to v2 and still working in progress for v2 as of 2019-08-03. Although there is a script to upgrade codes from v1 to v2, there are still lots of issues with v2 beta-0 and beta-1 running upgraded v1 codes.

$tf_upgrade_v2 --infile tf_v1 --outfile tf_v2
